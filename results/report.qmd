## Abstract

Write a brief one-paragraph abstract that describes the contents of your write-up.

## Dataset

The data used in this study was obtained from voluntary participants who provided blood samples for analysis. A total of 154 male children were included in the study, with 76 boys diagnosed with ASD and 78 boys who were considered typically developed. The mean age in the groupw as 5.7 years old, and the most common ethnicity was White, though other ethnicities included were African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, among others. Demographic data about the participants was also collected surrounding any prevailing clinical conditions and medications being used. A total of 1,317 proteins were measured from the blood samples obtained, but 192 of those proteins were not considered suitable and were dropped from the analysis, leaving 1,125 proteins included in the study. The protein data was normalized by a log10 transform and a z transform, with any observations that exceeded a +3 or a -3 value after the z transformation being dropped as outliers.

## Summary of published analysis

Summarize the methodology of the paper in 1-3 paragraphs. You need not explain the methods in depth as we did in class; just indicate what methods were used and how they were combined. If possible, include a diagram that depicts the methodological design. (Quarto has support for [GraphViz and Mermaid flowcharts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html).) Provide key results: the proteins selected for the classifier and the estimated accuracy.
